Thanos wants to destroy the avengers base, but he needs to destroy the avengers along with their base.
Let we represent their base with an array, where each place can be occupied by atmost one avenger and each avenger occupy exactly one place. Length of their base is a perfect power of 2. Destroying a place costs Thanos some of his power. He wants to destroy their place using minimum power. He starts with whole base and he can do either of following
1. Divide the base into 2 equal halves and destroy them separately.
2. Destroy it. If it contains no avenger in it, then it takes his A amount of power, else it takes his B * (number of avengers in that portion of base) * (length of that portion of base) amount of power.
Output the minimum power needed by Thanos to destroy the avengers base.
