Iron Man's assistant Jarvis found a colony of villains. The colony contains n holes and in each hole one villain lives. Each type of villain is described by a character, this means the colony can be represented as a string where ith character represents the type of villain lives in ith hole. Iron Man can destroy the colony if all villains of a certain type either live in first half of colony or in the second half of colony. Now, Jarvis has a special power, he can swap holes of any two villains, i.e. he can swap any 2 characters in the string, and he can do it as many times as he like. Now, Iron Man asks jarvis q questions, in each questions he gives Jarvis two numbers i and j, and jarvis have to tell iron man number of distinct colony arrangements he can create such that iron man can destroy that colony and the villains living in ith hole and jth hole (in original colony) live in same half.
